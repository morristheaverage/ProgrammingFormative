        <p>Origins of Robotics find place all around the literature and history.</p>

        <p>For instance, even the monster created by Dr.Frankenstein can be classified as a certain version of a robot, only that he was made out of human pieces and not mechanical ones.
           By the way, he was also working on electricity.</p>

	<p>Robots can be classified into 3 types:</p>

		<tr>
			<td>These are automatic machines which do not contain complex circuit. They are developed just to extend human potential. For Example- Washing Machine.</td>
			<td>These robots are programmed but can never be reprogrammed. These robots contain sensor based circuit & can perform multiple tasks. For Example- Fully Auto$</td>
			<td>These robots are programmed and can be reprogrammed as well. They contain complex model based circuit. For Example- Laptop or Computer.<td>

   <h3>Types of robotics.</h3>
	<p>Robotics is an area of interest to human beings for more than one hundred years. On the other hand, our perception over robots is influenced by the media and international film industry (Hollywood). You may ask- what robotics is all about? In my views, a robot’s distinctiveness transforms depending on the atmosphere it works in. Some of these are as follows:-</p>
	<ol><b><i>Outer Space</i></b> – Robotic arms that are under the control of a human being are employed to unload the docking cove of outer-space shuttles to launch satellites or to build a space station.</ol>
	<ol><b><i>The Intelligent Home</i></b> – Robotic systems can nowadays scrutinize home safety, ecological circumstances and energy consumption. Door & windows can be unlocked mechanically and electrical device such as lights and A/C can be pre-programmed to turn on. This helps residents to enjoy appliances irrespective of their mobility.</ol>
	<ol><b><i>Exploration</i></b> – Robots can enter the environments that are injurious to human beings. An illustration is observing the atmosphere within a volcano or investigating our deep marine life. NASA has utilized robotic probe for environmental study, ever since the early 60’s.</ol>
	<ol><b><i>Military Robots</i></b> – Flying robot drones are brought into play for close watch in present time’s modern armed force. In the future robotic airplane and automobiles could be employed to transmit petroleum, bullets, bombs, etc or clear minefields.</ol>
	<ol><b><i>Farms</i></b> – Programmed robots are used by harvesters to cut and collect crops. Robotic milk farms are existing permitting workers to nourish and milk their cattle distantly.</ol>
	<ol><b><i>The Car Industry</i></b> – Robotic arms are used, these arms are able to execute numerous tasks in the car manufacturing & assembling procedure. They carry out jobs such as sorting, cutting, welding, lifting, painting and bending. Similar functions but on a minor scale are now being intended for the food industry to execute tasks like- the trimming, cutting and processing of different types of meats like- chicken, beef, fish, lamb, etc.</ol>
	<ol><b><i>Hospitals</i></b> – The development of a robotic suit is under construction that will allow nurses to raise patients without injuring their backbones. Scientists in Japan have crafted a power facilitated suit which will provide nurses the additional power that they need to lift patients.</ol>
	<ol><b><i>Disaster Areas</i></b> – Observation robots built-in with superior sensing and imaging gears. This robot can work in dangerous environments like urban site spoiled by earthquakes by inspecting floors, walls, and roofs for structural reality.</ol>
	<ol><b><i>Entertainment</i></b> – Interactive robots that shows behaviors and education capability. One such robot is owned by SONY which moves around freely, responds to all your commands, carries your luggage and even responds to your oral instructions.</ol>
	
   <h3>Applications</h3>
	<p>Currently, robots perform a number of different jobs in numerous fields and the amount of tasks delegated to robots is rising progressively. The best way to split robots into types is a partition by their application.</p>
	<ol><b><i>Industrial robots</i></b> – These robots bring into play in an industrialized manufacturing atmosphere. Typically these are articulated arms particularly created for applications like- material handling, painting, welding and others. If we evaluate merely by application then this sort of robots can also consist of some automatically guided automobiles and other robots.</ol>
	<ol><b><i>Domestic or household robots</i></b> – Robots which are used at home. This sort of robots consists of numerous different gears for example- robotic pool cleaners, robotic sweepers, robotic vacuum cleaners, robotic sewer cleaners and other robots that can perform different household tasks. Also, a number of scrutiny and tele-presence robots can also be considered as domestic robots if brought into play in that sort of environment.</ol>
	<ol><b><i>Medical robots</i></b> – Robots employed in medicine and medicinal institutes. First & foremost surgical treatment robots. Also, a number of robotic directed automobiles and perhaps lifting supporters.</ol>
	<ol><b><i>Service robots</i></b> – Robots that cannot be classed into any other types by practice. These could be various data collecting robots, robots prepared to exhibit technologies, robots employed for research, etc.</ol>
	<ol><b><i>Military robots</i></b> – Robots brought into play in military & armed forces. This sort of robots consist of bomb discarding robots, various shipping robots, exploration drones. Often robots at the start produced for military and armed forces purposes can be employed in law enforcement, exploration and salvage and other associated fields.</ol>
	<ol><b><i> Entertainment robots</i></b> – These types of robots are employed for entertainment. This is an extremely wide-ranging category. It begins with model robots such as robosapien or the running photo frames and concludes with real heavy weights like articulated robot arms employed as movement simulators.</ol>
	<ol><b><i>Space robots</i></b> – I would like to distinct out robots employed in space as a split apart type. This type of robots would consist of the robots employed on Canadarm that was brought into play in space Shuttles, the International Space Station, together with Mars explorers and other robots employed in space exploration & other activities.</ol>
	<ol><b><i>Hobby and competition robots</i></b> – Robots that is created by students. Sumo-bots, Line followers, robots prepared merely for learning, fun and robots prepared for contests.</ol>
