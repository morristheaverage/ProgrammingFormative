## Interest of content

Excellent - 4 interesting topics chosen. 

## Consistency and quality of visual presentation

Very Good - A nice clean layout, although some inconsistency e.g. AI page uses three columns.

## Quality of written presentation

Very good - Information was written very well and clearly expressed all the information that was useful. However, this was often the result of copy and pasting but oh well. Some paragraphs were out of place and didn't make much sense e.g. quantum computing and applications part

## Validity of HTML

Good - Most pages were relatively free of errors. Article1 (robotics) was not.

## Evidence of colloboration

Weak - no author pages? but github page shows reasonable display of collaboration including not doing things too last minute
